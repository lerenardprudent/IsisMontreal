<p><img id="pic1" src="media/ico1.png" width="64" height="64" vspace="1" hspace="15" align="left" />Let's start with a couple of definitions in order to clear up the terminology which is often used in a "liberal", confusing way in the literature.
<b>Survey (statistical):</b> a <i>process</i> of data collection with the aim of making statistical inferences about a population from a sample of that population.<br/>A survey uses different data aquisition methods such as questionnaires, data from already available sources (websites, databases, etc.) and sensors (gps, accelerometers, glucometers, pH meters ,etc.). A survey can be of limited duration or open-ended and can contain multiple data aquisition segments (from questionnaires, sensors, etc.) at diferent points in time.
<b>Questionnaire:</b> a <i>document</i> (electronic or paper-based) used as <i>data collection tool</i> and containing a series of <i>forms</i> organized in a structured way in order to gather the required information. The navigation through the structure is based on a series of logic rules and conditions, such as the value of the previous answers or/and the demographic profile of the participant.
<b>Form:</b> a <i>document</i> (electronic or paper-based) containing a series of questions with dedicated spaces for the answers (input objects). Some of the input objects (text fields, radio buttons, check boxes, sliders, etc.) may have restrictions in regard with the value and the format of the answer and may be optional or mandatory.
Now that we have a common language, let's see how TREKSOFT SMAPP for RECORD GPMT can help you manage your surveys, the tasks and events related to the process and the participants.

<p>  <b>Before launching the questionnaire:</b>
	1 - meet the participant
	2 - open the USERS module from the MENU
	3 - from the QUICK SEARCH box in the USERS' LIST identify the individual<br/>	  using one of the following: the IPC #, the Dossier # or the first / last name.
	4 - if not found create his / her record using the AJOUTER button
	5 - if found update his / her basic info using the EDITER button
	6 - in both cases you need to have at least the following info actualized correctly:
	        TYPE (POT/PAR)<br/>	        IPC #<br/>	        DOSSIER #<br/>	        FIRST NAME<br/>	        LAST NAME<br/>	        GROUPE<br/>	        ETAPE<br/>	        STATUT<br/>	        SEX<br/>	        BIRTH DATE<br/>	        HOME MAIN PHONE NUMBER<br/>	        EMAILS<br/>	        ADDRESSE (INCLUDING THE 5 RELATED FIELDS)<br/>	        MOVED IN DATE			
	7 - some other fields may be important (ask the administrator)

    <b>What is "SKU"?</b>
    <p>SKU (stockkeeping unit, sometimes spelled "Sku") is an identification, usually alphanumeric, of a particular product that allows it to be tracked for inventory purposes. Typically, an SKU (pronounced with the individual letters or as SKYEW) is associated with any purchasable item in a store or catalog. For example, a woman's blouse of a particular style and size might have an SKU of "3726-8," meaning "Style 3726, size 8." The SKU identification for a product may or may not be made visible to a customer. SKU numbers can sometimes be seen in online e-commerce sites.
    A SKU is not the same as a product model / serial number from a manufacturer, although the model / serial number could form all or part of the SKU. <i>The SKU is established by the merchant.</i></p>
